========================================
# Overview
The 5D Deadfish with Multiverse Time Travel is a esoteric programming language created by Gianluca Rainis in the 2024.
It is an interpreted programming language based by the 5D Brainfuck with Multiverse Time Travel, the 5D 5D Brainfuck with Multiverse Time Travel with Multiverse Time Travel, the Deadfish and the 10D Deadfish 7 with Time Travel and a Multiverse.
The official file extension is .5dd, but the interpreters supports the most file extensions.
All the codes is free to use, modify and distribute.

# Deadfish Language Features

# Important notes
When you travel between the universes, you automaticaly go to the timeline 0 of the universe.

If you should travel in a previus timeline or a previus universe, and this universe/timeline doesn't exist, it will be created.

# Implementation
You can select the interpreter in the programming language that you prefer, and after compile it you just have to give it the location of the .5dd file.
(It works also with the .txt files)

Remember to give to the interpreter the position of the file without the '"'.

# Example
```
>>> it print "Hello, world!" in numbers

iiisdsiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiooiiioddddddddddddddddddddd
ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddoddddddddddddoddddddddddddddddddd
ddsddoddddddddoiiioddddddoddddddddodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
dddddddddddddddddddddddo
```

```
>>> it print "Hello, world!" in ASCII

iiisdsiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiuuiiiuddddddddddddddddddddd
ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddudddddddddddduddddddddddddddddddd
ddsddudddddddduiiiudddddduddddddddudddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
dddddddddddddddddddddddu
```

```
>>> it print "Hello world!" in ASCII with different universes

iiiiiiiisiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisi[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiiiiii[
iiiiiisdddd[
iiiiiiiiisiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiisiiiiiiii[
iiiiiiiiiis[
iiiiiisddd
U
```

```
>>> output of the G command (logical scheme)
